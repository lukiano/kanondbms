\section {Conclusions}
We came to the conclusion that the ARIES family of algorithms for locking and recovery is a very ingenious and effective method that is widely used in the industry by many of the commercial relational DBMS as well as some academic ones. This method faces with effectiveness the real problems of concurrence and recovery that are present in industrial-strength RDBMS.

This project pretends to serve as an aid to understand and observe the inner-work of a RDBMS. It was thought with academic aims, displaying to the user the internal engine operation in a simple way. It is showed how to build, from scratch, the ARIES family of algorithms with a simple, modular and object-oriented academic model. Whoever interested in the subject is able to look at the ARIES machinery in a fully functional way for a better comprehension of its inner-working.

The methodology that the ARIES papers establishes  fits well with complex subjects like transaction nesting, recovery from user errors and the use of save points.
